	<p> Never been to a concert and have future plans to go on one? Allow me to provide prior information about what might happen on the d&#45;day of a concert. </p>
	<p> But first, let me share my own concert experiences from the first time I had to go alone until the third time. </p>

	<p> January 23, 2016 was my first ever concert experience. It was EXO&#39;luXion in Manila, a world tour by the Korean boy group EXO. I had literally no idea on what is going to happen. I queued in line for several hours, 5 hours as far as I can remember, and thankfully there were good souls who approached me and talked to me while we were waiting and they became my concert buddies. </p>

	<br/>
	<p> The club&#39;luxion part was my favorite because everyone just had fun with the boys. This is a snippet of one of their performances, a song entitled "Run": </p>

	<p> February 25-26 this year they came back to the Philippines as one of the stops in the third leg of their world tour, the EXOr&#39;dium. Unlike the first time, I know very well how concerts work before, during, and after. I also had someone to go with for both days, yes, this time, I attended both days. </p>

	<p> Hanna and I went to Araneta Coliseum on the first day as early as 10am to claim our bundles, orders as well as take part in various giveaways from different local fanbases. I never knew it will be that fun even if we were walking and running from place to place under the heat of the sun. </p>
	<br/>
	<p> On the second day, I went to Araneta alone and I was lucky enough to spot someone I know and enjoyed the rest of the concert with them. This is my fancam from Day 2, the opening song and their debut song "MAMA" but a remix version for the concert: </p>

	<p><em> forgive the screams, it&#39;s so hard to control </em></p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<p> Given that I have enough experience on concerts, let me share some of the dos and don&#39;ts on d&#45;day: </p>
	<p align="left"><em> Disclaimer: I do not know if the same goes with western artists but based on my experience, almost all Korean acts have the same scenarios. </em></p>
	
	<ul align="left">
		<li> Prepare all the necessary things you need to bring a day or two before the concert day (i.e. concert ticket, power bank, lightstick, pocket money for merchs) </li>
		<li> Always behave properly especially when queuing for giveaways because I often experience that while queuing, securities get mad that they asks us to leave the place. </li>
		<li> When the concert starts, WAVE YOUR LIGHTSTICK, SING YOUR FANGIRL HEART OUT, AND CHEER FOR THEM. </li>
		<li> DO NOT bring dangerous weapons as it will also be inspected as you enter the arena. </li>
		<li> DO NOT push people while queuing in the line. All of you are the same, all of you are just fans, no one is superior nor inferior. </li>
		<li> AVOID raising banners, lighsticks and cellphones when the group is performing because it will hinder the fans at the back from watching. </li>
		<li> ALWAYS respect each other especially when you are in the pit section. </li>
		
	<p align="left"> AND, </p>
		
		<li> BE EXTRA CAREFUL AND MINDFUL. Take care of your belongings and yourself as well. I have encountered fansites who actually harm other fans just to take photos of the boys. </li>
	</ul>
		
		<p align="left"> AND, one more thing, think of every concert experience as your first and make the most out of every moment. </p>

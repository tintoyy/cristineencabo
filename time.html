	<p> I AM a hardcore fangirl. K&#45;pop fangirl, to be exact. I <em>stan</em> three groups and I make it to a point to update myself with their activities, group or individual, as much as possible. I invest my time and money for them. I buy official merchandises with my eyes closed. And I think that&#39;s true love. </p>
	<br/>
	<p> However &hellip; </p>
	<br/>
	<p> I am currently enrolled in a course where there is a retention policy implemented. We have to meet a quota grade in order to stay in the program and it is <strong>NO</strong> joke. </p>
	<br/>
	<p> But,</p>
	<br/>
	<p> I don&#39;t let fangirling affect my academic responsibilities and standings in the same way that I don&#39;t put all the time I have into academics alone.</p>
	<br/>
	<p> For this section, I am giving some of the things I consider when <u>balancing</u> and <u>handling</u> my fangirl and college life:
	<br/>
	<p><em> Disclaimer: These are the things <strong>I</strong> do and I do not encourage you to do so. </em></p>
	<br/>
	<ol>
		<li align="left"> Know when to save and when to starve </li>
		<p> When new merchandises or albums are released, I save up beforehand so that when pre&#45;order period arrives I have something to use to pay for it. The story behind the savings gets in &#45; at times, I don&#39;t eat lunch or anything at all in the university and just went straight home from classes just to save up. </p>

		<p><font size="2pt"><em> This is the most recent album I bought from their comeback with Kokobop. (I got a Version B and Private Version) </font></em></p>
		
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		<li align="left"> Livestream before anything else </li>
		<p> When time permits me, I watch livestream of their schedules first like awards shows, drama, etc. before doing a study proper. Honestly, this brings positive effect to my study habit as it keeps me awake and active. </p>

		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		<li align="left"> Not having enough memory storage </li>
		<p> In my phone, it is always a battle between the photos of my <em>faves</em> and photos of the lectures and diagrams I need for my classes. So when time comes that I need to sacrifice something, I delete some photos of my <em>faves</em> (but I make sure I have a file to backup those photos). </p>

		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		<li align="left"> Separate your personal and fangirl life in social media </li>
		<p> I have two Twitter accounts &#45; one is a personal account for my college self interactions and a fan account dedicated for my faves. These two accounts have two different feels and the fan account is the side of me that my college friends shouldn&#39;t see. Really. </p>

		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		<p align="left"> Lastly, </p>
		
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		<li align="left"> Know your priorities </li>
		<p> Take for example the recently administered prelim examinations. It was two weeks for me without proper updates about my <em>faves&#39;</em> activities and schedules however I controlled myself from staying and sticking with my phone and scroll through Twitter the whole night because I set my priorities straight. In times like those, academics come first. And I know that&#39;s what they want. </p>
